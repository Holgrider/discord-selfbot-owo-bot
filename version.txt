Current version: 1.0.9

-Now visible version on the menu.
-Change the version.txt file a bit (delete the Lastest version information because it's too useless)
-Now the option 2 (create new data) and load data is work perfectly fine
-Error not fixed in this version yet because *for some reason i don't see any error while running*
